        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I wanted to get a quick, overview of the data in the environment so I first looked at what kind of reports were being used by employees the most. </p>

        <p>I then dived deeper into the analysis and looked into multiple factors involved such as the elements and metrics, usage, run time, and source.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I was interested in the execution time of reports based on whether they successfully ran or not. To do this, I divided the Report Usage
        table based on the "Status" column which consisted of two values, Success and Failure, and conducted statistical analysis for each subgroup. Initially, the
        statistics I was getting didn't seem quite accurate but with a bit of filtering, I found that a small portion of each subset of the execution times (7-8%)
        exceeded 5 minutes and was heavily skewing my data. I decided it was best to eliminate those values.</p>
        <br>
        <div class = "status-images">
          <div class = "success">
            <img src="images/success.png" alt="decorative"/>
          </div>
          <div class = "failure">
            <img src="images/failure.png" alt="decorative"/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Surface level analysis showed that both distributions were still heavily skewed right. For the failed report executions distribution, there were two obvious
        spikes at two distinct places, one between 0-0.5 minutes and one between 1.5 and 2.5 minutes.
        <br>
        <p> Upon further investigation, at the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Less than 0.5 minutes spike -  Only 9% of the failures were due to user cancellation</li>
          <li>Between 1.5 and 2.5 minutes spike â€“ 81% of the failures were due to user cancellation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This means that most reports, if failed, fail quite early on while failures later on are usually the result of users manually cancelling the running of the report.</p>
